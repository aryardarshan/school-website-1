        The Brigade Schools have earned the reputation of being institutions of all round excellence. Our three schools at JP Nagar, Mahadevapura and
        Malleswaram, give the children a head start with the benefits of a unique, Montessori based pre-primary education. Our exceptional
        curriculum, along with co-curricular activities is designed with extra care. Our schools have been instituted by Brigade Foundation as part
        of its interest in Education, Health and Community Service.
        Our strong teaching staff, with supportive parents and enthusiastic students contribute to the success of the school. Our students have
        developed into confident young adults with a strong sense of awareness. In our three schools we recognize that all students are uniquely
        talented. The schools provide opportunities for children to do whatever they aspire to do - they could be future leaders of the country,
        get into premier institutions and follow their dreams!

        The facilities and excellent team of facilitators help the students develop positive relationships and the opportunity to realize their potential
        to the fullest. We provide an exceptionally caring and learning-focused environment for our students.
